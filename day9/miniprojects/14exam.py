# 14. Exam Result Processing

# Goal: Store and analyze student exam results.
# Requirements:
# Store results as: (student_name, (subject1_score, subject2_score, ...))
# Calculate total and average using sum(), len().
# Use indexing to access specific subject.
# Tuple immutability ensures original scores aren't altered.
