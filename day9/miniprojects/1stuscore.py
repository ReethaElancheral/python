# 1. Student Score Tracker

# Goal: Maintain and display student names with their subject scores using tuples.
# Requirements:
# Use a tuple to store each studentâ€™s data: (name, (math, physics, chemistry))
# Access subject-wise scores using indexing.
# Find average marks per student using sum() and len().
# Unpack each tuple to display name and subjects separately.
# Prevent accidental modification using tuple immutability.
