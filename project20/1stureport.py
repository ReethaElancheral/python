# âœ… 1. Student Report Card Generator

# Objective: Generate a simple report card.
# Requirements:
# Use variables to store student name, class, and marks (list).
# Use a for loop to calculate total and average.
# Use if-elif-else to assign grade:
# â‰¥90: A, 80â€“89: B, 70â€“79: C, else: D.
# Print report using f-string.
